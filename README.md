# Factors Affecting the Unemployment Rate

This project explores different factors affecting the unemployment rate in the U.S. It examines three datasets: **tobacco consumption, renewable energy, and government spending on education**.

## **1. Tobacco Consumption**
### **Analysis**  
This graph illustrates the relationship between the unemployment rate and tobacco usage in the U.S. (1995–2010). Both declined from 1996 to 2001. However, between 2001 and 2002, both increased due to the introduction of e-cigarettes and vaping products. After 2002, tobacco consumption steadily declined, but due to the **2008 financial crisis**, the unemployment rate surged to 10% by 2010.

## **2. Renewable Energy Consumption**
### **Analysis**  
The graph shows the trends in the unemployment rate and renewable energy consumption in the U.S. (1995–2010). While renewable energy consumption declined from 1997 to 2001, it then consistently increased until 2010. However, the unemployment rate increased after 2001, peaking at **10% in 2010**, mainly due to the **2008 financial crisis**.

## **3. Government Spending on Education**
### **Analysis**  
This graph compares **government education spending (as GDP share)** and the **unemployment rate** in the U.S. (2000–2020). Education spending slightly increased from 2000 to 2009 but dropped significantly in 2015 before rising again to **6% by 2020**, while the unemployment rate decreased.

## **Conclusion**
The study highlights how **tobacco use, renewable energy trends, and education spending** interact with **unemployment rates** in the U.S.
